I'm Joshua Luna-Li, a third year Computer Science student at Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson). <br/>
My program focus is on Machine Learning and Computer Vision, but outside of school you might find me:<br/>

\- 🚵 Ripping through the woods<br/>
\- 🏂 Jumping off of cliffs<br/>
\- 📷 Looking for the perfect shot<br/>
