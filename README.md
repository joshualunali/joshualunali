## Hi there 👋
I'm Joshua Luna-Li, a third year Computer Science student at Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson).
My program focus is on Machine Learning and Computer Vision, but outside of school you might find me:
\- 🚵 Ripping through the woods
\- 🏂 Jumping off of cliffs
\- 📷 Looking for the perfect shot
